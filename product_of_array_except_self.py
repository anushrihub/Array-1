# https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/

# Used the runnig product approach. In this with the loop find out the product of all elements to the left of each index stored in result array at the index position. Second loop is used to find the product of all element to the right of each index and multiply with the result array.    
# Time Complexity: O(n) Space Complexity: O(1)
